# Webject
Webjects are an object in web OOP.

Web developers, especially in front-end side, have a good intuition. 
Their intuition is well object-oriented, because they think and work in terms of UI objects, which are basically the HTML elements.

But, it does not necessarilly mean that their code beneath the HTML elements are object-oriented. That is the reason many web page source code has a long zigzag of deep indents.

An object is an independent, coherent, stackable set of knowledge. Objects are authogonal principal components that capture human intuition. Let a velocity be v = v1 + v2. Who would prefer v1 ** 2 + 2 * v1 * v2 + v2 ** 2 to simple, inturitive v ** 2, exept those programmers who mix everything together as soon as they cross over the shallow UI srceen into the code? What does 2*v1*v2 mean in this productivity world?
